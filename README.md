# Tribonacci Sequence Generator

This repository contains a Python script that generates the Tribonacci sequence, a variant of the Fibonacci sequence where each number is the sum of the three preceding ones.

## How It Works

The `tribonnaciSequence.py` script calculates the Tribonacci sequence up to a user-defined term. The sequence starts with three predetermined numbers and extends by summing the last three numbers to generate the next one.

## Getting Started
To run the script, you will need Python installed on your system. Clone this repository, navigate to the directory containing `tribonnaciSequence.py`, and run:
```
python tribonnaciSequence.py
```
